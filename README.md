# Thermodynamic-and-exergy-analysis-of-Kalina-cycle-system-11-KCS11-and-two-other-types-with-three-p
In this project, Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and Kalina cycle system 111a (KCS111a), are studied. The results are compared with a benchmark paper in the literature. Results show that the Kalina cycle system named 111a is much more efficient than the base cycle.
