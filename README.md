In this undergraduate thesis, Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and its more efficient and complicated configuration, Kalina cycle system 111a (KCS111a), are studied. Kalina cycle system is a modified Rankine cycle proposed by Alexander Kalina, which operates via the solution of water-ammonia instead of pure water. The new mixture's boiling point and temperature change differ from a pure fluid. The results are compared with a benchmark paper in the literature. The inlet fluid is supposed to be at three different temperature levels. The decision variables are pressure levels, mass flow rate, and ammonia concentration. Exergy and thermal efficiency are taken as the objective function, and the novel double pressure Kalina cycle and the base Kalina cycle are compared. Results show that the Kalina cycle system named 111a is much more efficient than the base cycle. It is also demonstrated that raising the heat source temperature increases the exergy efficiency of the base cycle, KCS11, while the new cycle, KCS111a, remains nearly the same. Engineering Equation Solver (EES) has been used to develop the codes.
